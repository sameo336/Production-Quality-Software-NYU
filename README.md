# Production-Quality-Software-NYU
PQS course under Professor Michael Schidlowsky at NYU Courtant

Course Description
In this course we study and practice the craft of software engineering. A proficiency in software engineering, as in any craft, is best obtained with consistent practice and a thoughtful and methodical development of skills. This course equips students with a mastery of the following:

A ubiquitous, general-purpose, programming language.
Low-level design principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and OOP, and how they are best applied in practice.
High-level design problems and their solutions in design patterns.
Industry-accepted best practices and development tools.
The course begins with an exposition of the Java programming language. Once students have mastered the language, they proceed to design principles, beginning with a thorough overview of object-oriented design and proceeding to more complex problems in API design and finally design patterns. Development tools and best practices are introduced throughout the semester. All topics are explained with real code. This allows students to ask questions, explore new ideas, and clarify principles by making changes to running code and observing the results. Slides are rarely used. Frequent practice is a key theme of the course. To that end, 1- and 2-week programming problems are assigned frequently. Often the assignments include code reviews of submissions to previous assignments by fellow students. This course is well-suited for students with a strong interest in software engineering.


Lecture Topics
The Java Language - An in-depth exposition.
Concurrency - The Java Memory Model and Thread Safety.
Object-Oriented Design - The evolution and pragmatic application of object-oriented principles.
API Design - Using encapsulation, abstraction, and defensive programming to design APIs that are safe, intuitive, and useful.
Design Patterns - High-level solutions to common software design problems.
Testing - How to write effective tests and how to incorporate them into the the development process. Development Tools - Revision control, continuous builds, and development metrics.
Engineering Management - How creativity, productivity, and work habits affect the development process and long-term quality of software.
