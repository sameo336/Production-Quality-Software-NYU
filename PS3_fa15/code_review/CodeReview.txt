StopWAtchImplementation.java
1) There is no final in String ID. Id should be final
2) List of laptimes should be final
3)Object lock should be final
4)list of laptimes should be Collections.Synchronized(List). This is for getting a synchronized list.
5)The constructor should be default
6)The List of laptimes should be initialized in the constructor
7)startTime=0l in reset. She has not done that.
8) instead of date.getTime() we should use System.NanoTime() and then convert it into milliseconds. This way the time is more precise.
9) in getLatimes() she has directly returned the reference to lapTimes. She should return a clone.
10) toString is poorly written, should have lock and use getters to get the values.
11) no getters defined!
12) variables stopwatchstatus and starttime are not camel cased!

StopwatchFactory.java:
1)Stopwatch list is not final. Also should have used Collections.synchronized(list). 
Better and easy method would have been to use a hashMap!
2)IStopwatch List-stopwatchlist should be final!
3)getStopWatch function should be final!
4)in getstopwatches she is returning the reference directly. She should return a clone!
